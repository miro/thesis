This chapter presents phases from a project done before the writing of this thesis. The execution of the project was done with no intention of it being a part of a thesis work. All the data shown here are gathered afterwards and thus do not meet the requirements of a proper scientific study. The project is presented here as an example project of a small budget startup. Section~\ref{sec:objectives} describes the objectives and starting point of the project. Section~\ref{sec:execution} introduces the execution of the phases in detail. Section~\ref{sec:qa_case} describes the methods used for improving quality in the project. Section~\ref{sec:achieved_quality} evaluates the quality achieved in the project based on the interviews of the project team and customer.
