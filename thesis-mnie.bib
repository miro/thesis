Access to the Internet has assumed new significance for commercial and political reasons, and remote and sparsely populated areas typically lack the telecommunications infrastructure for reliable and fast Internet connections. Even as government programs such as the federal E-rate provisions bring Internet connectivity for institutions such as schools and libraries under the government's universal service umbrella, more general Internet access to a broader community constituency has not been addressed within policy circles. Even the deployment of so-called “national” Internet services favors urban regions.

Research associates Kyle Nicholas and Lisa Parker were instrumental in undertaking this research, as was financial support from Southwestern Bell and the Rural Policy Institute. The comments of an anonymous reviewer helped greatly.},

	abstract = {At first blush, mobile media may appear a promising solution to the problem arising from the fact that parents in the present-day kindergarten institution rely almost solely on teachers' retrospective reports on their child's daily activities. However, a kindergarten is a delicate social fabric that mixes professional roles (the teachers') with socio-emotional relationships (parenting and caring) and involves stakeholders who are dependent on adults in the use of technology (the children). To date, no studies have been reported that critically examine the boundary conditions for successful mobile media applications in such settings. We present a study of Meaning, a one-button capture-and-push-to-Web solution that was used by a Finnish kindergarten for a month. Interviews and the amount of media sent suggest that the intervention was a success, and we report on seven uses of media. However, all uses were critically affected by the users' social fabric, in which the teachers were the nexus. We conclude by discussing various ways in which the heterogeneity of the user group affected mobile media use.},

	abstract = {Mobile browser is known to be slow because of the bottleneck in resource loading. Client-only solutions to improve resource loading are attractive because they are immediately deployable, scalable, and secure. We present the first publicly known treatment of client-only solutions to understand how much they can improve mobile browser speed without infrastructure support. Leveraging an unprecedented set of web usage data collected from 24 {iPhone} users continuously over one year, we examine the three fundamental, orthogonal approaches a client-only solution can take: caching, prefetching, and speculative loading. Speculative loading, as is firstly proposed and studied in this work, predicts and speculatively loads the subresources needed to open a webpage once its {URL} is given. We show that while caching and prefetching are highly limited for mobile browsing, speculative loading can be significantly more effective. Empirically, we show that client-only solutions can improve the browser speed by about 1.4 second on average for websites visited by the 24 {iPhone} users. We also report the design, realization, and evaluation of speculative loading in a {WebKit}-based browser called Tempo. On average, Tempo can reduce browser delay by 1 second ({\textasciitilde}20\%).},

However, new emerging standards such as {HTML}5 and {WebGL} are removing the remaining limitations and transforming the Web into a real software platform. In this paper we argue that the trend towards web-based software will cause a paradigm shift in the software industry from binary applications to dynamically delivered web applications. In the future, the use of conventional binary programs will be limited to system software, whereas the vast majority of end user software will be developed using web technologies.

	abstract = {Web caching in mobile networks is critical due to the unprecedented cellular traffic growth that far exceeds the deployment of cellular infrastructures. Caching on handsets is particularly important as it eliminates all network-related overheads. We perform the first network-wide study of the redundant transfers caused by inefficient web caching on handsets, using a dataset collected from 3 million smartphone users of a large commercial cellular carrier, as well as another five-month-long trace contributed by 20 smartphone users. Our findings suggest that redundant transfers contribute 18\% and 20\% of the total {HTTP} traffic volume in the two datasets. Also they are responsible for 17\% of the bytes, 7\% of the radio energy consumption, 6\% of the signaling load, and 9\% of the radio resource utilization of all cellular data traffic in the second dataset. Most of such redundant transfers are caused by the smartphone web caching implementation that does not fully support or strictly follow the protocol specification, or by developers not fully utilizing the caching support provided by the libraries. This is further confirmed by our caching tests of 10 popular {HTTP} libraries and mobile browsers. Improving the cache implementation will bring considerable reduction of network traffic volume, cellular resource consumption, handset energy consumption, and user-perceived latency, benefiting both cellular carriers and customers.},

	doi = {10.1109/CSMR.2007.33},
	abstract = {Recently, a new Web development technique for creating interactive Web applications, dubbed Ajax, has emerged. In this new model, the single-page Web interface is composed of individual components which can be updated/replaced independently. If until a year ago, the concern revolved around migrating legacy systems to Web-based settings, today we have a new challenge of migrating Web applications to single-page Ajax applications. Gaining an understanding of the navigational model and user interface structure of the source application is the first step in the migration process. In this paper, we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic Web applications for this purpose. Our approach, using a schema-based clustering technique, extracts a navigational model of Web applications, and identifies candidate user interface components to be migrated to a single-page Ajax interface. Additionally, results of a case study, conducted to evaluate our tool, are presented},

Observing the User Experience will help you bridge that gap to understand what your users want and need from your product, and whether they'll be able to use what you've created. Filled with real-world experience and a wealth of practical information, this book presents a complete toolbox of techniques to help designers and developers see through the eyes of their users. It provides in-depth coverage of 13 user experience research techniques that will provide a basis for developing better products, whether they're Web, software or mobile based. In addition, it's written with an understanding of how software is developed in the real world, taking tight budgets, short schedules, and existing processes into account. ·Explains how to create usable products that are still original, creative, and unique·A valuable resource for designers, developers, project managers-anyone in a position where their work comes in direct contact with the end user.·Provides a real-world perspective on research and provides advice about how user research can be done cheaply, quickly and how results can be presented persuasively·Gives readers the tools and confidence to perform user research on their own designs and tune their software user experience to the unique needs of their product and its users},

	abstract = {Does "Web 2.0" mean anything? Till recently I thought it didn't, but the truth turns out to be more complicated. Originally, yes, it was meaningless. Now it seems to have acquired a meaning. And yet those who dislike the term are probably right, because if it means what I think it does, we don't need it.

I first heard the phrase "Web 2.0" in the name of the Web 2.0 conference in 2004. At the time it was supposed to mean using "the web as a platform," which I took to refer to web-based applications. [1]

So I was surprised at a conference this summer when Tim O'Reilly led a session intended to figure out a definition of "Web 2.0." Didn't it already mean using the web as a platform? And if it didn't already mean something, why did we need the phrase at all?},

	title = {Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures},
	url = {http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm},
	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.

Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.

This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer ({REST}) architectural style and describe how {REST} has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web.

{REST} emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding {REST} and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying {REST} to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},
